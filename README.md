# CV-MiniProjects

Welcome to the CV-MiniProjects repository.
This repository showcases two computer vision mini-projects focused on image analysis and processing. 
Currently, the repository contains the following project:

## Image Classification - CNN

The Image Classification - CNN project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for identifying the presence of sunglasses in face images. The goal is to create a robust model that can accurately classify images into two classes: sunglasses present and sunglasses absent.

The project utilizes the CMU Face Images dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The project includes data loading, model training with hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation on a test set. 
The notebook provides insights into model behavior, addressing questions such as overfitting, the effect of batch size, and the choice of optimizer.

## Future Project

In the near future, a second mini-project will be added to this repository:

### Image Clustering - KMeans and DBSCAN

In this project the application of KMeans and DBSCAN algorithms for image clustering tasks will be explored.
